Micro Measurement Display 0 (uMD0) firmware running on the Atmega328p Nano 3.0 for low performance homodyne interferometers, encoders, and other devices producing Quad A/B signals.
uMD0 has a limited slew rate but is good for an introduction to metrology systems in education and industry.

uMD0 interfaces with the uMD GUI via USB on Windows PCs.
